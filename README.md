## ‚ú® Introduction

Welcome to the **Alphabet Learning App**, an interactive and fun Android application designed to help children learn to recognize and draw the letters of the alphabet. Built with modern Android development tools like Jetpack Compose and Kotlin, this app provides a smooth and engaging learning experience.

## üöÄ Features

*   **Interactive Letter Drawing:** Children can practice drawing letters directly on the screen with a simple finger-drawing interface.
*   **Letter Recognition (In Progress):** The app is under development to include a feature that recognizes the drawn letter and provides feedback.  *(This is a planned feature and will be available in a future update.)*
*   **Text-to-Speech:**  Letters are spoken aloud as they are displayed, reinforcing auditory learning and pronunciation.
*   **Clear and Next Buttons:** Easily clear the drawing area and move to the next letter in the alphabet.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed with simplicity and ease of use in mind, making it accessible for young learners.
*   **Jetpack Compose:** Built with a modern UI toolkit for a responsive and dynamic user interface.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

*   **Kotlin:**  The primary programming language, known for its conciseness and safety features.
*   **Jetpack Compose:**  The modern, declarative UI toolkit from Google, simplifying UI development.
*   **Android SDK:**  The core framework for building native Android applications.
*   **TextToSpeech API:**  Android's built-in API for converting text into spoken output.
